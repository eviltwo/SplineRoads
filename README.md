# Spline Roads
These are components for creating roads using Unity's Splines.

## Spline Span Instantiate
The basic functionality is the same as the default `SplineInstantiate`, but it has been improved to allow selection of the Spline index, start, and end. Using this, you can plant trees on only part of a path or remove fences midway along a path.
- Allows specification of the Spline index, start, and end points.
- Adjustable alignment of objects to slopes.
- Simplified implementation by removing definitions of certain Spaces.
